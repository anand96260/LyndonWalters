 <p><strong>Important note:</strong></p>
 <p>While the philosophy and psychology behind Mind/Body Science (e.g. Neuro-Linguistic Programming commonly called &lsquo;Talk Therapy&rsquo;), the suggestibility of Hypnosis, the energy status behind Reiki and the remarkable potential for individuals to access and utilize the principle of the Placebo Effect, the core factor to any degree of progress or not must rest solely with any action/non-action taken by those individuals. Use of their capabilities to glean new learning in order for them to make individual progress is a matter of preference by those individuals. Their internal dialogues and undiluted belief systems are often considered by individuals as leading to &lsquo;Knowingness&rsquo;, possibly! Individuals must make decisions whether they are internally driven to make such changes as is required in order to access significant individual clarity through &lsquo;Self Discovery&rsquo;. <br />
   <br />
   It is the responsibility of each individual to become more aware of self and with the advent of a new Mindset but looking from a new set of perspectives. It is likely that any singular discipline or permutations of the above disciplines might or might not be deemed by individuals as being causative to produce remarkable clinical results. Even though testimonials from individuals, who are best positioned to comment, confirm the efficacy or otherwise of the practice of using such principles or affiliated &lsquo;tools&rsquo; to elicit bona fide results, it must still be considered to be in the experimental stage. Thus all Clients must take complete responsibility for their use of Mind/Body Science when interacting with Lyndon Walters as a Relationship, Development and Performance Coach/Practitioner, findingthetreasureinyou.co.uk or LyndonWalters.com. </p>
 <p><strong>Lyndon Walters is <u>not</u> a Medical Doctor. <u>He does not offer, recommend nor does he give advice about Medical Matters. It must be further understood that Lyndon strongly insists that individuals seek Medical advice, intervention and treatment from a Medical Source only for all Medical conditions without exception</u></strong><u>.</u></p>
